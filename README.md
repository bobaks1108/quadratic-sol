Quadratic equation solution calculator.
======================================

This bash script calculates the solutions of a Quadratic Equation. 

```
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
```

An example quadratic equation is 5x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0

For this the solution is: x = −0.2 or x = −1


To run the program:

Ensure you have permission to run the quadratic_sol.sh script.

Change to the directory containing the script and set the permission to executable for the owner of the file (presuming you are the owner of the file).
```
chmod u=rwx quadratic_sol.sh
```

Run the script:

```
./quadratic_sol.sh [arguments]
```

You must supply 3 arguments for a,b and c.

* the value of a cannot be 0
* all values must be integers (i.e. whole numbers - negative of postitive)

```
. quadratic_sol.sh 5 6 1
```
